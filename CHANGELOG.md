### gateway-service (0.1.1)

- Hardening: `GATEWAY_SECRET` must be at least 32 characters.

- Docs: deploy JWT/env checklist; OpenAPI description links to it.

### internal-api (0.1.1)

- Hardening: `GATEWAY_SECRET` must be at least 32 characters.
- Docs: OpenAPI `info` links to deploy JWT/env checklist.
